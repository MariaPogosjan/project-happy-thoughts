# Happy Thoughts
In this week's project we created a site similar to Twitter, named â€˜happy thoughtsâ€™ ðŸ’Œ. We practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem
I started with fetching the api to get the existing data in App.js After that I created two more components, one for the message list and one for the form where the users can post their messages. When I had built the structure of the app I styled it according to the guidelines and built methods to post messages and likes to the API. 

I also added some fun functions as animations when the user has written more than 140 characters, submits their message, error message and a loader. I used some great npm libraries for some of the functions: 

moment to convert time     
React-Toastify to add nice looking alert message to notice the user about an error
React-loader-spinner to have a heart loder before the message list fetch is done.

I had a huge problem with connecting my heart button and the amount of likes, and also getting the date to be able to show how many likes a user has made compared to the existing likes. From my one to one with our code coach and some great googling I managed to solve it and got a great result.
